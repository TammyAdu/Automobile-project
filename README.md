# Car Price Prediction Project
This project focuses on predicting the price of cars based on various features such as curb weight, symboling, normalized losses, height, make, and body style. The prediction model is deployed using Streamlit and can be accessed [here](https://autoproject.streamlit.app/).
## Overview
The prediction model utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset containing information about cars' specifications and prices. By leveraging these features, the model predicts the price of cars with a high degree of accuracy.
## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes the following columns:
- Curb Weight: The weight of the car without occupants or baggage.
- Symboling: Insurance risk rating associated with the car's safety.
- Normalized Losses: The relative average loss payment per insured vehicle year.
- Height: The height of the car.
- Make: The manufacturer of the car.
- Body Style: The body style of the car.
- Price: The price of the car.
## Steps Taken
1. **Data Collection**: The dataset was collected from [source].
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocessing steps were applied to the dataset, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: EDA was conducted to gain insights into the data distribution, relationships between variables, and identify any patterns or trends.
4. **Feature Engineering**: New features were created, and existing features were modified to improve model performance.
5. **Model Selection**: Various machine learning algorithms were evaluated, and the best performing model was selected based on evaluation metrics such as accuracy, RMSE, and R-squared.
6. **Model Training**: The selected model was trained on the dataset using techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.
7. **Model Evaluation**: The trained model was evaluated using appropriate metrics and validated to ensure robustness and generalization.
8. **Deployment**: The final model was deployed using Streamlit to create an interactive web application for predicting car prices based on user input.
## Achieving Optimal Solution
To achieve a predictive accuracy of 95%, the following strategies were employed:
- Thorough feature selection: Relevant features were carefully chosen based on domain knowledge and feature importance analysis.
- Model optimization: Hyperparameter tuning and model selection techniques were utilized to optimize model performance.
- Rigorous evaluation and validation: The model underwent extensive evaluation and validation processes to ensure its accuracy and generalization to unseen data.
## Future Improvements
- Integration of additional data sources such as car specifications and market trends to enhance model performance.
- Fine-tuning of model parameters and exploring advanced machine learning techniques to further improve accuracy.
- Continuous monitoring and updating of the model to adapt to changing dynamics in the automotive industry.
